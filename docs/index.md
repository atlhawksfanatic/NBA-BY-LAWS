*If you are only interested in a pdf or epub of the Constitution and By-Laws, then please click on the download icon at the top left (it is next to the "A") and select the format you wish to download.*

The NBA's Constitution and By-Laws were [released to the public](http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/files/221035054-nba-constitution-and-by-laws.pdf) in the wake of the [Donald Sterling incident](https://deadspin.com/that-secret-nba-constitution-is-now-online-1569509012). The NBA now hosts their own version of their Constitution and By-Laws on [nba.official.com](https://official.nba.com/) with the [most recent version here](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2019/09/NBA-Constitution-By-Laws-September-2019-1.pdf). In the interest of having these documents a bit easier to navigate -- as I previously did with the NBA's [2017 Collective Barginaing Agreement](https://atlhawksfanatic.github.io/NBA-CBA/) (CBA) -- I have parsed the Constitution and By-Laws and formatted the two documents via [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

I do not own any rights to the Constitution or By-Laws and am simply redistributing them in a different format. This is not the official version of either the Constitution and By-Laws and I am not responsible for any errors that might be present in this document. If you believe you have found an error, please let me know and I will correct it.
