A Player may be placed on a Member’s Armed Services List at any time after such Player has been inducted into the Armed Services; provided, however, that a Player may be placed on such Armed Services List from the Member’s Active List or Inactive List only once during the same period of active service in the Armed Services if such Player has played in any Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff Games during the period of active service.</li>
<li>A Player who was under contract with a Member at the time of his induction into the Armed Services and who, upon his release, requests re-employment prior to February 15, must be tendered a contract on the same terms and conditions as the contract in existence at the time he was so inducted. Such Player must be “tried out” and, notwithstanding the provision of Sections 6.02 and 6.03 of these By-Laws governing the maximum number of Players that may be carried on an Active List or Inactive List, may participate in Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff Games. If such a returning Player requests re-employment on or after February 15, he must similarly be tendered a contract and “tried out” and, notwithstanding the provisions in said Sections 6.02 and 6.03 of these By-Laws, may participate in Exhibition and Regular Season Games but may not participate in Playoff Games.</li>
<li>The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall also apply to returning servicemen not previously under contract with a Member; provided, however, that no more than two (2) such Players may be “tried out” by a Member at any one time.</li>
<li>A Player who has played in any Regular Season Game or Playoff Game while in the Armed Services and who, upon his release from the Armed Services, is entitled to employment or reemployment pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) hereof must, notwithstanding the provisions of those subsections, be included in determining the maximum number of Players on the Member’s Active List and Inactive List provided for in Sections 6.02 and 6.03 of these By-Laws.</li>
