## PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION

This Constitution and By-Laws constitutes a contract among the Members of the Association.

(b) No Owner shall, directly or indirectly, lend money to or become a surety or guarantor for any Member other than a Member in which it owns an interest, any Player of any Member other than a Member in which it owns an interest, any Referee, the Commissioner or any other employee of the Association, except that Owners that engage in commercial lending as a principal business activity may enter into such lending, surety, or guarantee arrangements with such other Members or persons if (i) such arrangements are disclosed in detail to the Board of Governors and approved by three-fourths (3/4) vote of all Governors, or (ii) such Owners do not have effective control of a Member, the lending, surety, or guarantee arrangements are between the Owner and a Player, Referee, or employee of the Association, and such arrangements are on terms customarily offered to similarly situated individuals not affiliated with the Association.
(c) Neither the Commissioner nor any Referee nor any other employee of the Association shall, directly or indirectly, hold stock or have a financial interest in any Owner or lend money to or become a surety or guarantor for any Owner.

## TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP

No Membership, nor any direct, indirect, contingent, or convertible interest therein (regardless of the size of the interest), may be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, or otherwise transferred or encumbered (each a "transfer") in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, except in accordance with and subject to the following provisions of this Article 5:

(a) An application requesting approval of a transfer must be made in writing to the Commissioner by the applicable Member (on behalf of the transferring Owner) promptly after an agreement with respect to such transfer has been reached. The Commissioner may waive this requirement and accept an application directly from a Prospective Owner that has a security interest previously approved by the Association in the interest proposed to be transferred or when, in the Commissioner's sole judgment, the best interests of the Association would be served.
(b) Upon receipt of such application, the Commissioner shall have the right to require from the transferring Owner, and the transferring Owner shall furnish or cause the proposed transferee to furnish to the Commissioner, such information as the Commissioner shall request about the transfer, the proposed transferee and each Prospective Owner, any persons or Entities with which the transferee or any Prospective Owner is associated or affiliated, and such other matters, whether or not confidential, as the Commissioner shall deem relevant in his sole discretion. The transferring Owner and its proposed transferee and each of its Prospective Owners shall also execute, deliver, and perform, and shall cause such other parties (including their respective controlled subsidiaries and affiliates) as the Commissioner shall direct to execute, deliver, and perform, such documents in such forms as the Commissioner shall prescribe. It shall be the obligation of the transferring Owner to ensure that the Commissioner timely receives all information that the Commissioner may request under this Article 5.
(c) Any agreement to transfer an interest in a Member or Membership, and any application requesting approval of such transfer, shall include a binding agreement of the proposed transferee and each of its Prospective Owners stating that if the transfer is approved by the Association, the proposed transferee and each of its Prospective Owners (and each of their respective controlled subsidiaries and affiliates) shall be bound by the Constitution and By-Laws, rules, regulations, resolutions, and agreements of the Association, and any modifications or amendments thereof.
(d) An application requesting approval of a transfer of an interest in a Member or Membership equal to or larger than ten percent (10\%), or such smaller interest as may result in a change of control over such Member or Membership, shall be accompanied by a certified check from the transferring Owner to the order of the Association in the sum of \$50,000 to defray all expenses (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) incurred by the Association in investigating, reviewing, and processing the application. Following the disposition of any application, the Association shall repay to the applicant the sum of \$50,000, less all expenses incurred in connection with the application. If these expenses exceed \$50,000, the additional expenses shall be assessed against the Member and promptly paid to the Association.
(e) With respect to an application requesting approval of a transfer of an interest in a Member or Membership of less than ten percent (10\%) (other than a transfer that would result in a change of control over such Member or Membership), all expenses incurred by the Association in investigating, reviewing, and processing the application (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) shall be assessed against the Member and promptly paid to the Association.
(f) Upon receipt of an application requesting approval of a transfer, the Commissioner shall conduct such investigation as the Commissioner deems appropriate. Upon the completion of the investigation, the Commissioner shall submit the proposed transfer to the Members for approval, together with all information in respect thereto that the Commissioner deems pertinent. A transfer shall only become effective if approved by the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths (3/4) of all Governors at a meeting duly called for such purpose.
(g) The Commissioner shall appoint a committee to assist him in matters relating to proposed transfers of Membership interests (for purposes of this Article 5, the "Committee").
(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5(f):
    (i) If a proposed transfer involves (x) a larger than five percent (5\%) but smaller than ten percent (10\%) interest in a Member or Membership (including an interest subject to Article 5(h)(iii)), or (y) the transfer of a Membership or an interest in a Member or Membership to a different Entity owned by substantially the same Owners in substantially the same proportions (provided that the aggregate direct and indirect changes in ownership, if any, do not equal or exceed ten percent (10\%)), the Committee shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to approve such proposed transfer without submitting it to the Members for approval under Article 5(f) above, unless (A) the transfer would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of ten percent (10\%) or larger in a Member or Membership, or (B) the effect of such proposed transfer is or may be to change the ownership of effective control of such Member or Membership.
    (ii) If a proposed transfer involves (x) a five percent (5\%) or smaller interest in a Member or Membership, or (y) the transfer of a Membership or an interest in a Member or Membership to a different Entity owned by substantially the same Owners in substantially the same proportions (provided that the aggregate direct and indirect changes in ownership, if any, do not exceed five percent (5\%)), the Commissioner shall have the power, in his sole discretion, to approve such proposed transfer without submitting it to the Members for approval under Article 5(f) above, unless (A) the transfer would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the Committee or the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of larger than five percent (5\%) but smaller than ten percent (10\%) in a Member or Membership, (B) the transfer would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of ten percent (10\%) or larger in a Member or Membership, or (C) the effect of such proposed transfer is or may be to change the ownership of effective control of such Member or Membership.
    (iii) This Article 5 shall not be applicable to a proposed transfer of any interest in a Member or other Owner in which the number of individuals and Entities directly or indirectly owning interests prior to such proposed transaction exceeds five hundred (500), unless (w) the interest proposed to be transferred represents a direct or indirect interest of five percent (5\%) or larger in a Member or Membership, (x) the transfer would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the Committee or the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of at least five percent (5\%) but less than ten percent (10\%) in a Member or Membership, (y) the transfer would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of ten percent (10\%) or larger in a Member or Membership, or (z) the effect of such proposed transaction is or may be to change the ownership of effective control of such Member or Membership.
    (iv) If a proposed transfer is in the form of a pledge, lien or hypothecation of a Membership or an interest in a Member or Membership in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness that does not exceed the then-current Association limits on secured indebtedness of a Member, the Commissioner shall have the power, in his sole discretion, to approve such proposed transfer without submitting it to the Members for approval under Article 5(f) above, upon and subject to such conditions as the Commissioner shall determine.
(i) Any addition, replacement, or substitution of a trustee or a beneficiary of a trust that is an Owner shall be deemed a transfer of the entire interest owned by that trust, unless the Commissioner shall determine that the interest to be transferred is only a portion of the interest owned by the trust (in which case the interest deemed to be transferred for purposes of this Article 5 shall be such portion).
(j) Absent a compelling reason to the contrary as determined by the Board of Governors, it shall be the policy of the Association not to approve a proposed transfer of an interest in a Member or Membership to (i) any governmental or quasi-governmental authority, agency, or instrumentality, or (ii) any person or Entity not satisfying any minimum ownership criteria that may be established from time to time by the Commissioner, the Committee, or the Board of Governors.
(k) Any violation of the provisions of this Article 5 shall constitute a violation of Article 13(b).

## LIMITATIONS ON INDEBTEDNESS

The Board of Governors (and such committees of the Board as it or the Commissioner may appoint) shall have the right to establish limits on the indebtedness and other obligations that any Member or Owner may incur.

## RELOCATION

A Member may transfer its Team, city of operation, or playing site of any or all of its home games to a different location within or outside its existing Territory, as defined in Article 10, only in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article 7 and, where applicable, the provisions of Articles 8 and/or 9.

(a) Application to relocate must be made in writing by the Member to the Commissioner. The application shall identify the proposed new location and the arena in which the Member proposes to play its home games, and shall be accompanied by an Application Fee (in the form of a certified check to the order of the Association) in the sum of \$50,000, if the proposed new location is within the Member's Territory, or \$250,000, if the proposed new location is outside of the Member's Territory, to defray the costs of the investigation of the application. Following the disposition of any application, the Association shall repay to the applicant the amount of the Application Fee, less all expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation of the application (including attorneys' fees). If these expenses exceed the Application Fee, the additional expenses shall be assessed against the Member and promptly repaid to the Association.
(b) No application to relocate may be made after the first day of March preceding the Season in which the proposed relocation is to take effect. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of an application to relocate, the Commissioner shall refer the application to a committee for investigation (the "Relocation Committee"). The Relocation Committee shall be appointed by the Commissioner and shall consist of no fewer than five (5) Governors or Alternate Governors. Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the Commissioner's receipt of the application, the Committee shall report to the Board of Governors with respect to the results of its investigation and its recommendation of whether the application should be granted or denied. The recommendation of the Relocation Committee shall be based solely and exclusively upon the following factors:
    (i) The support of the Member's Team in the existing location by fans, telecasters, broadcasters, and sponsors. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the Member's past performance in the management and operation of its Team in the existing location.
    (ii) The ability of the Member's existing location to support a Team in the Association. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the following criteria with respect to the Member's existing location: existing and projected population, income levels, and age distribution; existing and projected markets for radio, broadcast television, cable television, and other forms of audio-visual transmission of Association games; existing and projected business environment; the size, quality, and location of the Member's existing arena and any other arena in the existing location, and the terms, if any, on which that other arena would be available to the Member; and the presence, history, and popularity in the existing location of other professional sports teams and other forms of entertainment.
    (iii) The ability of the proposed new location to support a Team in the Association or, if the proposed new location is within the existing Territory of a Member, the ability of the proposed new location to support another Team. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the following criteria with respect to the proposed new location: projected support of the Member's team by fans, telecasters, and sponsors; existing and projected population, income levels and age distribution; existing and projected markets for radio, broadcast television, cable television, and other forms of audio-visual transmission of Association games; existing and projected business environment; the size, quality and location of the arena in which the Member proposes to play its home games; and the presence, history and popularity in the proposed new location of other professional sports teams and other forms of entertainment.
    (iv) The Member's ability to operate an Association team successfully in the proposed new location. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the applicant's present and projected financial condition and its financial resources.
    (v) The Member's past performance in the management and operation of its Team in the Association.
    (vi) The effect of the proposed relocation on the Association's ability to market and promote Association basketball on a nationwide basis in a diverse group of geographic markets.
    (vii) The effect of the proposed relocation on the Association's existing or prospective commercial relationships with telecasters, broadcasters, sponsors, and others.
    (viii) The extent to which the proposed new location presents particular disadvantages for the operation of the Association, such as by creating significant traveling or scheduling difficulties or because of adverse laws or regulations.
    (ix) The interest of other Members, in addition to the applicant, in transferring their Teams to the proposed new location, or the interest of other persons or Entities in obtaining a new Membership to operate an NBA team in the proposed new location. In any such event:
        (A) Except as otherwise provided herein, all applicants shall follow the procedures set forth in Article 4 or this Article 7, as the case may be. All additional applications to establish an NBA team in the proposed new location for the Season to which the initial application relates shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the Commissioner's receipt of the initial application referred to in subparagraph (a), and the one hundred twenty (120) day period provided for in subparagraph (b) of this Article 7 shall be extended by no longer than forty-five (45) days after the Commissioner's receipt of the initial application.
        (B) The Relocation Committee shall investigate each of the applications and shall recommend which of the applications, if any, should be granted. In reaching its recommendation, the Relocation Committee shall consider all factors listed in subparagraphs (b)(i-viii) of this Article 7 and shall also consider:
            (i) which applicant is likely to operate most successfully in the proposed new location, or otherwise best serve the interests of the Association; and
            (ii) in the case of a proposed expansion team to be operated by a new Member, whether the interests of the Association would best be served by expanding the number of Members in the Association.
(c) The Relocation Committee is empowered to require from the applicant, and the applicant shall furnish, such information as the Relocation Committee deems appropriate for the conduct of its investigation. The Relocation Committee may engage consultants or other experts to assist it in the investigation of the application and may also request such additional information from the Commissioner as the Committee may deem appropriate for the conduct of its investigation. All information supplied to the Relocation Committee pursuant to this subparagraph (c) (other than confidential communications of counsel) shall be made available to the applicant, and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Committee to present whatever additional information or arguments the applicant desires. Any other member of the Board of Governors or his representative, or any other party from which the Relocation Committee wishes to hear, may also appear before the Relocation Committee to present whatever information or arguments such Governor or party desires.
(d) The report and recommendation of the Relocation Committee shall be delivered to each member of the Board of Governors. The Commissioner shall call a meeting of the Board of Governors to consider the Relocation Committee's report and recommendation, which meeting shall be held no sooner than seven (7) days and no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Committee's report and recommendation. The applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Board of Governors to present whatever information or arguments the applicant desires. The question whether to approve the proposed relocation shall be decided by a majority vote of all of the Members, and no vote by proxy shall be permitted. The vote of each Governor on the proposed relocation shall be based solely and exclusively upon the factors listed in subparagraphs (b)(i–ix) of this Article.
(e) The Board of Governors shall have the right to attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to its approval of a proposed relocation, including, but not limited to, that the Member indemnify and release the Association from any and all claims arising out of the proposed relocation and that the Member pay a reasonable fee in connection with the relocation of its Team. In establishing the amount of such a fee, the Board of Governors may consider, among other factors, the value to the Association of the business opportunity represented by the relocation, and any increase in the value of the Member that results from the relocation. Any fee so charged may be distributed among the other Members of the Association in such proportion as the Board of Governors shall determine.

## ARENAS

(a) The Commissioner shall have the power from time to time (i) to establish minimum standards for the design, construction, and operation of NBA-quality arenas in areas related to the production and marketing of NBA basketball games and events; (ii) to establish minimum standards for the conditions under which NBA basketball games and events are conducted, and to regulate the in-arena presentation of those games and events; (iii) to establish procedures for ensuring compliance with this Article 8; and (iv) to enforce such standards and procedures, including through the imposition of appropriate penalties. It shall be the responsibility of the Member, and not the responsibility of the Association, to ensure that the Member's arena complies with all applicable statutes, regulations, and ordinances. Nothing contained in Articles 8(b)-(d) below shall be construed as limiting the applicability of this Article 8(a) to all Members.
(b) In addition to complying with Article 7 and the other provisions of this Article 8, any Member seeking to transfer the playing site of any or all of its home games to a different location (other than a proposed transfer under Article 9) shall be subject to and shall comply with the following provisions:
    (i) If a Member seeks to relocate to an arena that will be newly constructed or substantially renovated for use by the Member's team:
        (A) the Member shall obtain a written determination from the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the arena's construction or renovation that all designs, plans, and specifications for the newly-constructed or renovated arena required to be submitted pursuant to Article 8(a) above have been submitted and comply substantially with the minimum arena standards of the Association; and
        (B) the Member shall obtain a written determination from the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) prior to holding any practice, exhibition, or game involving NBA players at the newly-constructed or renovated arena that the construction or renovation of the arena has been completed in substantial compliance with the minimum arena standards of the Association.
    (ii) If a Member seeks to relocate to an already-existing arena that will not be substantially renovated for its use, the Board of Governors shall have no obligation to consider the Member's Article 7 application at the meeting called for that purpose unless the Member shall obtain a written determination from the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) at least thirty (30) days prior to such meeting either stating (x) that the arena substantially complies with the minimum arena standards of the Association (as determined by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee), or (y) that specified modifications are necessary in order for the arena to comply substantially with such standards, that the Team has agreed in a Writing to make such modifications, and that the Team has supplied to the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) design plans sufficient to evidence its intent to make such modifications. If specified modifications are required, the Member shall not hold or attempt to hold any practice, exhibition, or game involving NBA players at the arena unless it has received a written determination from the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) that the modifications have been completed and that the arena substantially complies with the minimum arena standards of the Association.
    (iii) No Member's application to relocate will receive final approval under Article 7 unless the Member has received the written determination(s) of the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee) required under either clause (i) or clause (ii) above.
    (iv) For purposes of this Article 8, "substantial compliance" with the NBA's minimum arena standards shall be solely determined by the Commissioner (or the Commissioner's designee).
    (v) Any Member that fails to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph (b) shall be subject to a fine of up to \$5,000,000 to be imposed by the Commissioner.
(c) In addition to any other arena compliance obligations it may have under Article 8(a), a Member who receives approval to relocate under Article 7 shall ensure that its arena continues to comply with the NBA's minimum arena standards in effect at the time the Member received the written determination(s) required by paragraph (b) above.
(d) For any violation of Article 8(a) or 8(c) above, the Commissioner shall have the right to impose a fine against the Member of up to \$250,000 per game (Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff) for each game that the Member's team plays in the arena during the period when it is in violation of such provisions.

## CERTAIN PLAYING SITE RELOCATIONS

Articles 7, 8(b), and 8(c) shall not apply to a request by a Member, in accordance with this Article 9, to transfer the home playing site of one or more of its Regular Season or Playoff Games to a different facility under the following circumstances:

(a) the usual home playing site is unavailable on a date scheduled for a Playoff Game;
(b) an unanticipated event or emergency renders the usual home playing site temporarily unavailable or unsuitable and the Member wishes to play its home games during such period at another facility; or
(c) the Member seeks to schedule up to four (4) of its Regular Season home games at another playing site within its Territory.

In order for a Member to transfer the home playing site of any of its Regular Season or Playoff Games under the circumstances set forth in Article 9(a), 9(b), or 9(c) above, the Member must make an application in writing to the Commissioner, who is empowered to grant or deny such application, either unconditionally or upon specific conditions, as in his judgment shall be in the best interests of the Association (based on such factors as the Commissioner deems appropriate, including the extent to which the arena to which the Member seeks to relocate complies with the NBA's minimum arena standards). An application pursuant to Article 9(a) or 9(b) shall be made promptly upon the occurrence of the event rendering the home playing site unavailable or unsuitable, and an application pursuant to Article 9(c) must be made on or before the first day of May preceding the Season in which the Member proposes to play up to four (4) of its home games at the additional playing site. An application pursuant to this Article 9 shall specify the reasons for the proposed transfer and shall be accompanied by such further information and documentation as the Commissioner may deem appropriate.

## TERRITORY

(a) Subject to any rules, regulations, resolutions, or agreements of the Association, or any agreement between the affected Members that has been approved by the Association, (i) the Territory of a Member shall be the territory within an area of seventy-five (75) air miles of the corporate limits of the city of operation, except that when the line circumscribing the Territory of a Member intersects with the line circumscribing the Territory of another Member, the respective Territories shall be evenly divided by a line between the two (2) points of intersection ("Territory") and (ii) a Member may also conduct and authorize promotions, community events and sponsor advertising and activities (x) within the area of the U.S. state in which the Member's home games are played that is outside the Territory of such team, and (y) within an area of one-hundred-fifty (150) air miles of the corporate limits of its city of operation (collectively, "Expanded Marketing Territory"), provided that a Member's Expanded Marketing Territory shall not extend into the Territory of another Member.
(b) Except in accordance with any rules, regulations, resolutions, or agreements of the Association, (i) a Team operated by a Member shall have no right to play in the Territory of another Member without the consent of the resident Member; and (ii) subject to Article 10(a)(ii) and (c), no Team shall conduct any of its operations outside of its Territory.
(c) In addition to the territorial rights set forth in Article 10(a) above, a Member shall have priority within the corporate limits of any city in which its Team has played not less than three (3) home Regular Season Games during the preceding Season, provided that it has requested and receives the prior approval of the Association to play in such location. Such priority shall continue so long as such Member's Team continues to play not less than three (3) home Regular Season Games in such city in each succeeding consecutive Season; provided, however, that the Commissioner, in his discretion, may, by Written Notice to each of the Members of the Association, excuse the failure of the Team of any Member to play such minimum number of games in such city in any one (1) Season, in which event such Member's priority in such city shall continue notwithstanding its Team's failure to play such minimum number of games in such city during such Season. "Priority," as used in this paragraph (c), means a preference granted to schedule and play home Regular Season Games and home pre-season Exhibition Games within the corporate limits of such city.

## RESIGNATION OF A MEMBER

A Member may resign from the Association at the end of any Season provided Written Notice of such resignation shall have been given to the Commissioner and other Members of the Association at least three (3) calendar days prior to the commencement of the NBA Draft immediately following such Season. However, such resignation shall be effective only if, within thirty (30) days of such notice, the resigning Member shall have (a) made full payment of all dues or other debts owing to the Association, its Members, and any third-party creditors designated by the Association; and (b) assigned to the Commissioner the contracts of its Players, its arena lease (if assignable) and its Membership, in each case free and clear of all liens, claims, and encumbrances. The Commissioner shall have the power to deal with and dispose of such contracts, lease, and Membership as if said Member had suffered an event described in Article 14A hereof. Upon the effective date of such resignation, the resigning Member shall hold no further interest in its Player Contracts, lease, or Membership.

## BANKRUPTCY OF A MEMBER

For purposes of this Article 12, a Member shall be deemed to be involved in a bankruptcy proceeding if it makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, a receiver is appointed for all or substantially all of its assets, it voluntarily files a petition for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code or any foreign or state law providing for relief of debtors, or any such petition is filed against it and not discharged within thirty (30) days. The Members of the Association each acknowledge that substantial hardship may result to the creditors of a Member involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, to the other Members of the Association, and to the public if the operations of such Member's Team are not continued under the direction of a qualified person having no relationship to such Member. Therefore, if any Member is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, the Association shall have the option, exercisable by a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the Board of Governors (the Member involved in the bankruptcy proceedings not being considered a Member of the Board of Governors for purposes of this Article), to cause such Member and its assets and properties to be placed under the management and control of the Commissioner. Upon exercise of such option, the Commissioner shall be deemed authorized to take the following actions: to appear on behalf of the Association in any court in which a bankruptcy proceeding is pending; to cause the Member's Team to continue to play its Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff Games; to collect all revenues from every source payable to the Member and apply such revenues, to the extent available, to the payment of such Member's operating expenses; and to take such further action as he shall deem advisable to accomplish the purpose of the option, all subject to the supervision and control of the court having jurisdiction over the bankruptcy proceeding. The management and control by the Commissioner shall continue until the first to occur of termination of the bankruptcy proceeding, transfer of such Member's Membership in the Association in accordance with and subject to Article 5, termination of such Member's Membership in the Association, or a determination by a majority of the Board of Governors (the Member involved in the bankruptcy proceeding not being considered a Member of the Board of Governors for purposes of this Article) that continuation of such management and control is no longer advisable. The existence or exercise of the option shall not impose upon the Association or any of its Members any requirement to provide funds to a Member involved in a bankruptcy proceeding or any liability for another Member's debts or obligations.

## TERMINATION OF OWNERSHIP OR MEMBERSHIP

The Membership of a Member or the interest of any Owner may be terminated by a vote of three fourths (3/4) of the Board of Governors if the Member or Owner shall do or suffer any of the following:

(a) Willfully violate any of the provisions of the Constitution and By-Laws, resolutions, or agreements of the Association.
(b) Transfer or attempt to transfer a Membership or an interest in a Member without complying with the provisions of Article 5.

## PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION

The Membership of a Member or the interest of any Owner shall be terminated on the occurrence of any of the events described in Article 13 by the following procedure:

(a) Any Member of the Association or the Commissioner may charge that a Member or Owner has violated one (1) or more of the provisions of Article 13. Said charge shall be made in Writing and shall be filed with the Commissioner, who shall, no later than three (3) business days after the charges are filed, cause a copy thereof to be served by a Writing upon the Member or Owner against whom such charges have been made.
(b) The Member or Owner so charged shall, within five (5) days after receipt of the charges, file with the Commissioner its written answer thereto. The Commissioner shall thereupon transmit said charges and answer to each of the Governors of the Association and shall call a special meeting of the Governors to hear the charges, to be held on a date not more than ten (10) days after the filing of a Member's or Owner's answer, due notice to be given.
(c) Willful failure by a Member or Owner so charged to answer the charges during such five (5) day period or to appear at the hearing shall be deemed an admission by said Member or Owner of the total validity of the charges as presented.
(d) At such hearing, the Chairman of the Board of Governors shall be the presiding officer, except that if the Chairman of the Board of Governors represents either the complaining Member or the Member charged, then the Commissioner shall designate an alternate Chairman for purposes of the hearing.
(e) At the hearing, the Member or Owner so charged shall have the right to be represented by counsel. Strict rules of evidence shall not apply, and all relevant and material evidence submitted prior to and at the hearing may be received and considered.
(f) After duly considering all the evidence, the Board of Governors shall vote upon the proposition that the charges have been sustained in whole or in part. The affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all the Governors shall be required to sustain the charges.
(g) If, by a three-fourths (3/4) vote, the Board of Governors votes to sustain the charges, the Membership of the guilty Member or the Member in which the guilty Owner has an interest shall automatically be terminated, unless, following a motion duly made and seconded, two-thirds (2/3) of all the Governors vote instead to terminate the ownership interest of the guilty Owner or to invoke the provisions of Article 15.
(h) Notwithstanding Article 14(g) above, in the case of a violation of Article 13 by an Owner who has an interest of ten percent (10\%) or less in, and does not have effective control over, a Member, the Membership of such Member may not be terminated solely because of such Owner's violation. In such case, if the charges are sustained against such Owner by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Board of Governors, the ownership interest of that Owner shall be automatically terminated unless, following a motion duly made and seconded, two-thirds (2/3) of all the Governors vote to invoke the provisions of Article 15.
(i) If any Membership or interest of an Owner shall be terminated pursuant to this Article 14, the provisions of Article 14A shall apply.
(j) The decisions of the Association made in accordance with the foregoing procedure shall be final, binding, and conclusive, and each Member and Owner waives any and all recourse to any court of law to review any such decision.

### CONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION

(a) When the Membership of a Member is terminated, such Member and its assets, properties and operations shall be placed under the management and control of the Commissioner, who shall have the following powers: to cause the Member's Team to continue to play its Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff Games; to collect all revenues from every source payable to the Member and apply such revenues, to the extent available, to the payment of such Member's debts and obligations; and, as directed by a majority of the Board of Governors (the Member whose Membership was terminated not being considered a Member of the Board of Governors for the purposes of this Article), either to transfer such Member's Membership (including its Player Contracts and other assets) in accordance with and subject to Article 5 or to liquidate the Player Contracts and other assets of the Member in an orderly manner in the best interests of the Member and its creditors, and the Association, in each case at such prices and on such terms as the Commissioner shall deem reasonable and appropriate.
(b) When the interest of any Owner is terminated, that interest shall, unless the Commissioner has approved an alternative arrangement, be placed under the management and control of the Commissioner, who shall have the power to exercise all of the rights otherwise exercisable by the Owner of that interest, including, but not limited to, any management or voting rights and the right to transfer all or any portion of that interest in accordance with and subject to Article 5 at such prices and on such terms as the Commissioner shall deem reasonable and appropriate.
(c) All proceeds from any transfer of a Member's Membership or the liquidation of its Player Contracts and other assets, or of an Owner's interest in a Member, shall be applied first to discharge the liabilities and obligations to all creditors of the Member (or Owner), including the Association and its Members but excluding any Owner of the Member, second to discharge the liabilities and obligations to any Owner of the Member, and any balance shall be remitted to the Member (or Owner). The existence or implementation of this Article 14A shall not impose upon the Association or any of its Members any requirement to provide funds to any Member (or Owner) or any liability for any debts or obligations of any Member (or Owner).

## ALTERNATIVES TO TERMINATION

If a charge that a Member or Owner has committed any of the offenses described in Article 13 is sustained, two-thirds (2/3) of all the Governors may waive the remedy of termination, and instead direct the Member or Owner to pay a stated fine in a stipulated manner and by a stipulated date, which fine may be required to be paid, in whole or in part, to any other Member or Members as compensation to such Member or Members for damages sustained by it or them by reason of such act or acts of omission or commission by such offending Member or Owner. Such fine shall be payable within five (5) days after its imposition. Moreover, the Board of Governors may, in its discretion, either in addition to, or in lieu of, such fine, direct the forfeiture of the offending Member's Draft rights.

## DISSOLUTION

The Association may be dissolved at any time by a three fourths (3/4) vote of all the members of the Board of Governors at a meeting duly called for this purpose. Upon dissolution, the assets of the Association shall be distributed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
