<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Application to relocate must be made in writing by the Member to the Commissioner. The application shall identify the proposed new location and the arena in which the Member proposes to play its home games, and shall be accompanied by an Application Fee (in the form of a certified check to the order of the Association) in the sum of $50,000, if the proposed new location is within the Member’s Territory, or $250,000, if the proposed new location is outside of the Member’s Territory, to defray the costs of the investigation of the application.

If these expenses exceed the Application Fee, the additional expenses shall be assessed against the Member and promptly repaid to the Association.</li>
<li>No application to relocate may be made after the first day of March preceding the Season in which the proposed relocation is to take effect. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of an application to relocate, the Commissioner shall refer the application to a committee for investigation (the “Relocation Committee”). The Relocation Committee shall be appointed by the Commissioner and shall consist of no fewer than five (5) Governors or Alternate Governors. Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the Commissioner’s receipt of the application, the Committee shall report to the Board of Governors with respect to the results of its investigation and its recommendation of whether the application should be granted or denied. The recommendation of the Relocation Committee shall be based solely and exclusively upon the following factors:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>The support of the Member’s Team in the existing location by fans, telecasters, broadcasters, and sponsors. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the Member’s past performance in the management and operation of its Team in the existing location.</li>
<li>The ability of the Member’s existing location to support a Team in the Association. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the following criteria with respect to the Member’s existing location: existing and projected population, income levels, and age distribution; existing and projected markets for radio, broadcast television, cable television, and other forms of audio-visual transmission of Association games; existing and projected business environment; the size, quality, and location of the Member’s existing arena and any other arena in the existing location, and the terms, if any, on which that other arena would be available to the Member; and the presence, history, and popularity in the existing location of other professional sports teams and other forms of entertainment.</li>
<li>The ability of the proposed new location to support a Team in the Association or, if the proposed new location is within the existing Territory of a Member, the ability of the proposed new location to support another Team. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the following criteria with respect to the proposed new location: projected support of the Member’s team by fans, telecasters, and sponsors; existing and projected population, income levels and age distribution; existing and projected markets for radio, broadcast television, cable television, and other forms of audio-visual transmission of Association games; existing and projected business environment; the size, quality and location of the arena in which the Member proposes to play its home games; and the presence, history and popularity in the proposed new location of other professional sports teams and other forms of entertainment.</li>
<li>The Member’s ability to operate an Association team successfully in the proposed new location. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee shall consider the applicant’s present and projected financial condition and its financial resources.</li>
<li>The Member’s past performance in the management and operation of its Team in the Association.</li>
<li>The effect of the proposed relocation on the Association’s ability to market and promote Association basketball on a nationwide basis in a diverse group of geographic markets.</li>
<li>The effect of the proposed relocation on the Association’s existing or prospective commercial relationships with telecasters, broadcasters, sponsors, and others.</li>
<li>The extent to which the proposed new location presents particular disadvantages for the operation of the Association, such as by creating significant traveling or scheduling difficulties or because of adverse laws or regulations.</li>
<li>The interest of other Members, in addition to the applicant, in transferring their Teams to the proposed new location, or the interest of other persons or Entities in obtaining a new Membership to operate an NBA team in the proposed new location. In any such event:
(A) Except as otherwise provided herein, all applicants shall follow the procedures set forth in Article 4 or this Article 7, as the case may be. All additional applications to establish an NBA team in the proposed new location for the Season to which the initial application relates shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the Commissioner’s receipt of the initial application referred to in subparagraph (a), and the one hundred twenty (120) day period provided for in subparagraph (b) of this Article 7 shall be extended by no longer than forty-five (45) days after the Commissioner’s receipt of the initial application.
(B) The Relocation Committee shall investigate each of the applications and shall recommend which of the applications, if any, should be granted. In reaching its recommendation, the Relocation Committee shall consider all factors listed in subparagraphs (b)(i-viii) of this Article 7 and shall also consider:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>which applicant is likely to operate most successfully in the proposed new location, or otherwise best serve the interests of the Association; and</li>
<li>in the case of a proposed expansion team to be operated by a new Member, whether the interests of the Association would best be served by expanding the number of Members in the Association.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Relocation Committee is empowered to require from the applicant, and the applicant shall furnish, such information as the Relocation Committee deems appropriate for the conduct of its investigation. The Relocation Committee may engage consultants or other experts to assist it in the investigation of the application and may also request such additional information from the Commissioner as the Committee may deem appropriate for the conduct of its investigation. All information supplied to the Relocation Committee pursuant to this subparagraph (c) (other than confidential communications of counsel) shall be made available to the applicant, and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Committee to present whatever additional information or arguments the applicant desires. Any other member of the Board of Governors or his representative, or any other party from which the Relocation Committee wishes to hear, may also appear before the Relocation Committee to present whatever information or arguments such Governor or party desires.</li>
<li>The report and recommendation of the Relocation Committee shall be delivered to each member of the Board of Governors. The Commissioner shall call a meeting of the Board of Governors to consider the Relocation Committee’s report and recommendation, which meeting shall be held no sooner than seven (7) days and no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of the Committee’s report and recommendation. The applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Board of Governors to present whatever information or arguments the applicant desires. The question whether to approve the proposed relocation shall be decided by a majority vote of all of the Members, and no vote by proxy shall be permitted. The vote of each Governor on the proposed relocation shall be based solely and exclusively upon the factors listed in subparagraphs (b)(i–ix) of this Article.</li>
<li>The Board of Governors shall have the right to attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to its approval of a proposed relocation, including, but not limited to, that the Member indemnify and release the Association from any and all claims arising out of the proposed relocation and that the Member pay a reasonable fee in connection with the relocation of its Team. In establishing the amount of such a fee, the Board of Governors may consider, among other factors, the value to the Association of the business opportunity represented by the relocation, and any increase in the value of the Member that results from the relocation. Any fee so charged may be distributed among the other Members of the Association in such proportion as the Board of Governors shall determine.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.14</span> PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION</h2>
<p>The Membership of a Member or the interest of any Owner shall be terminated on the occurrence of any of the events described in Article 13 by the following procedure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Any Member of the Association or the Commissioner may charge that a Member or Owner has violated one (1) or more of the provisions of Article 13. Said charge shall be made in Writing and shall be filed with the Commissioner, who shall, no later than three (3) business days after the charges are filed, cause a copy thereof to be served by a Writing upon the Member or Owner against whom such charges have been made.</li>
<li>The Member or Owner so charged shall, within five (5) days after receipt of the charges, file with the Commissioner its written answer thereto. The Commissioner shall thereupon transmit said charges and answer to each of the Governors of the Association and shall call a special meeting of the Governors to hear the charges, to be held on a date not more than ten (10) days after the filing of a Member’s or Owner’s answer, due notice to be given.</li>
<li>Willful failure by a Member or Owner so charged to answer the charges during such five (5) day period or to appear at the hearing shall be deemed an admission by said Member or Owner of the total validity of the charges as presented.</li>
<li>At such hearing, the Chairman of the Board of Governors shall be the presiding officer, except that if the Chairman of the Board of Governors represents either the complaining Member or the Member charged, then the Commissioner shall designate an alternate Chairman for purposes of the hearing.</li>
<li>At the hearing, the Member or Owner so charged shall have the right to be represented by counsel. Strict rules of evidence shall not apply, and all relevant and material evidence submitted prior to and at the hearing may be received and considered.</li>
<li>After duly considering all the evidence, the Board of Governors shall vote upon the proposition that the charges have been sustained in whole or in part. The affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all the Governors shall be required to sustain the charges.</li>
<li>If, by a three-fourths (3/4) vote, the Board of Governors votes to sustain the charges, the Membership of the guilty Member or the Member in which the guilty Owner has an interest shall automatically be terminated, unless, following a motion duly made and seconded, two-thirds (2/3) of all the Governors vote instead to terminate the ownership interest of the guilty Owner or to invoke the provisions of Article 15.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding Article 14(g) above, in the case of a violation of Article 13 by an Owner who has an interest of ten percent (10%) or less in, and does not have effective control over, a Member, the Membership of such Member may not be terminated solely because of such Owner’s violation. In such case, if the charges are sustained against such Owner by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Board of Governors, the ownership interest of that Owner shall be automatically terminated unless, following a motion duly made and seconded, two-thirds (2/3) of all the Governors vote to invoke the provisions of Article 15.</li>
<li>If any Membership or interest of an Owner shall be terminated pursuant to this Article 14, the provisions of Article 14A shall apply.</li>
