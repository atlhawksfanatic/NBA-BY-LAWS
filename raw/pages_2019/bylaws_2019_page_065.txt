                                                                       57
                              ARTICLE 44
                 AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES
             Each Owner shall cause each of its affiliates and
subsidiaries over which it has or can exercise effective control to
comply with the Constitution and By-Laws, rules, regulations,
resolutions, and agreements of the Association, and any amendments
and modifications thereof. If any such affiliates or subsidiaries of an
Owner violates the foregoing sentence, such Owner and, in the case of
violations committed on behalf of, as agent for, or for the benefit of, a
Member (including, but not limited to, actual or proposed
compensation arrangements with Players that violate NBA rules), the
applicable Member shall be subject to the same penalties as if that
Owner (or Member) had itself committed that violation.
                              ARTICLE 45
                        CONFLICT WAIVER
             Each Member and Owner acknowledges that from time to
time they and the Association will jointly retain one or more law firms
or experts to represent and advise them (“League Advisors”). Each
Member and Owner agrees and consents to the representation of the
Association and the other Members and Owners by League Advisors in
connection with any and all controversies and disputes, including any
litigation or other adversarial proceeding adverse to such Member or
Owner. In any such adverse representation, the current or prior
representation of such Member or Owner by that League Advisor, and
the information that was conveyed to that League Advisor in the course
of such representation, shall not be asserted as, and shall not constitute,
a basis to disqualify that League Advisor from the adverse
representation.
