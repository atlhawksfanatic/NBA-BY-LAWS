                                                                        9
            (d) Upon receipt of any application for Membership in
the Association that the Association wishes to consider, the
Commissioner shall conduct such investigation thereof as the
Commissioner deems appropriate. Following the completion of such
investigation, the Commissioner shall submit the application to the
Members for approval, together with such information as the
Commissioner deems pertinent. Each Prospective Owner must be
approved by the affirmative vote of not less than three-fourths (3/4) of
all Governors at a meeting duly called for such purpose.
            (e) Each application for Membership shall be
accompanied by a certified check in the amount of $1,000,000 (the
“Application Fee”). If the application for admission is accepted, the
Application Fee shall be used to pay the fees, costs, and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Association in considering
the application and all related matters, and any remaining balance shall
be applied as a credit against the Membership fee to be paid by the
applicant. If the application for admission is denied, the Application
Fee shall be used to pay the fees, costs, and expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Association in considering the
application and all related matters, and any remaining balance shall be
repaid to the applicant. There shall be no obligation to pay interest on
any Application Fee submitted to and held by the Association.
