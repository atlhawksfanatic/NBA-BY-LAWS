                                                                     73
             6.08. Hardship. In the event that the application of the
provisions of these By-Laws pertaining to Player Lists and replacement
of Players shall, in any particular case, cause extreme hardship, such
provisions, upon application by the Member claiming hardship, may be
waived or modified, and special rules may be invoked for the Member
claiming such hardship; provided, however, that such provisions may
only be waived or modified by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
entire Board of Governors (the Governor representing the Member
claiming hardship not voting). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a Member has three (3) Players (other than Two-Way
Players) on its Active List and/or Inactive List who are unable to
perform playing services due to injury or illness and such Member has
an additional Player (other than a Two-Way Player) who becomes
unable to perform playing services due to injury or illness, it may
substitute a Player in his stead after the following has occurred:
             (a) each of the three (3) injured or ill Players and the
additional injured or ill Player has missed a minimum of three (3)
consecutive games due to injury or illness; and
             (b) the Commissioner’s Office has determined, through
an independent physician, if necessary, that at the time the replacement
Player is signed, each of the three (3) injured or ill Players on the
Member’s Active and/or Inactive List, and the additional injured or ill
Player, will continue to be unable to perform playing services due to
injury or illness.
             The Commissioner, in his sole discretion, may permit a
Member to replace additional injured or ill Players on that Member’s
Active List or Inactive List.
             6.09. Voluntarily Retired List. A Player who has not
completed the playing services called for under his Player Contract
may be transferred to the Voluntarily Retired List only after the
Commissioner is notified in a Writing by both the Player and the Team
with which he is under contract. No Player whose name appears on
any Member’s Voluntarily Retired List shall, without the unanimous
