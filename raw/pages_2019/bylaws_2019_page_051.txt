                              ARTICLE 30
          INDEMNIFICATION OF COMMISSIONER AND
                EMPLOYEES OF THE ASSOCIATION
              The Commissioner and the employees of the Association
will be indemnified by the Association against expenses actually and
necessarily incurred by them in connection with the defense of any
action, suit or proceeding to which they are made a party, and against
any judgments which may be rendered against them therein, by reason
of their being or having been Commissioner or an employee of this
Association, except in relation to matters as to which a court of
competent jurisdiction, in a proceeding to which they are a party, shall
have adjudged that such indemnification is contrary to law or against
public policy. Such right of indemnification shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which the Commissioner and/or
Association employees may be entitled under the Constitution and By-
Laws, any agreement with the Association, any vote by the Board of
Governors, or otherwise.
                              ARTICLE 31
                            ASSESSMENTS
              (a) Each Member shall contribute to the capital of the
Association a fixed annual capital contribution of $6,000.
              (b) In return for the services provided by the Association
to the Members, each Member shall be required from time to time to
pay assessments to the Association in an amount equal to six percent
(6%) of the gross gate receipts derived from all of its Regular Season
home games played in each Season, or $30,000 per Season, whichever
is greater. Each Member shall immediately after each such game send
to the Commissioner a report, on forms furnished by the Association,
of all the information required as to such game. The books with respect
to such payments shall be open to all Members of the Association.
