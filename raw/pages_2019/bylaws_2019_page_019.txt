             (d) An application requesting approval of a transfer of an
interest in a Member or Membership equal to or larger than ten percent
(10%), or such smaller interest as may result in a change of control
over such Member or Membership, shall be accompanied by a certified
check from the transferring Owner to the order of the Association in the
sum of $50,000 to defray all expenses (including, but not limited to,
attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Association in investigating, reviewing,
and processing the application. Following the disposition of any
application, the Association shall repay to the applicant the sum of
$50,000, less all expenses incurred in connection with the application.
If these expenses exceed $50,000, the additional expenses shall be
assessed against the Member and promptly paid to the Association.
             (e) With respect to an application requesting approval of
a transfer of an interest in a Member or Membership of less than ten
percent (10%) (other than a transfer that would result in a change of
control over such Member or Membership), all expenses incurred by
the Association in investigating, reviewing, and processing the
application (including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees) shall be
assessed against the Member and promptly paid to the Association.
             (f) Upon receipt of an application requesting approval of
a transfer, the Commissioner shall conduct such investigation as the
Commissioner deems appropriate. Upon the completion of the
investigation, the Commissioner shall submit the proposed transfer to
the Members for approval, together with all information in respect
thereto that the Commissioner deems pertinent. A transfer shall only
become effective if approved by the affirmative vote of not less than
three-fourths (3/4) of all Governors at a meeting duly called for such
purpose.
             (g) The Commissioner shall appoint a committee to
assist him in matters relating to proposed transfers of Membership
interests (for purposes of this Article 5, the “Committee”).
