             Commissioner shall determine.
             (i) Any addition, replacement, or substitution of a trustee

determined by the Board of Governors, it shall be the policy of the

Member or Membership to (i) any governmental or quasi-governmental
authority, agency, or instrumentality, or (ii) any person or Entity not
satisfying any minimum ownership criteria that may be established
from time to time by the Commissioner, the Committee, or the Board
of Governors.
             (k) Any violation of the provisions of this Article 5 shall
constitute a violation of Article 13(b).

establish limits on the indebtedness and other obligations that any
Member or Owner may incur.
