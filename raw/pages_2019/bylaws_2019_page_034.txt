                     BANKRUPTCY OF A MEMBER
              For purposes of this Article 12, a Member shall be deemed
to be involved in a bankruptcy proceeding if it makes an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, a receiver is appointed for all or substantially
all of its assets, it voluntarily files a petition for relief under Title 11 of
the United States Code or any foreign or state law providing for relief
of debtors, or any such petition is filed against it and not discharged
within thirty (30) days. The Members of the Association each
acknowledge that substantial hardship may result to the creditors of a
Member involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, to the other Members of

exercisable by a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of the Board of Governors
(the Member involved in the bankruptcy proceedings not being
considered a Member of the Board of Governors for purposes of this
Article), to cause such Member and its assets and properties to be
placed under the management and control of the Commissioner. Upon
exercise of such option, the Commissioner shall be deemed authorized
to take the following actions: to appear on behalf of the Association in
any court in which a bankruptcy proceeding is pending; to cause the
Member’s Team to continue to play its Exhibition, Regular Season, and
Playoff Games; to collect all revenues from every source payable to the
Member and apply such revenues, to the extent available, to the
payment of such Member’s operating expenses; and to take such
further action as he shall deem advisable to accomplish the purpose of
the option, all subject to the supervision and control of the court having
jurisdiction over the bankruptcy proceeding. The management and
control by the Commissioner shall continue until the first to occur of
termination of the bankruptcy proceeding, transfer of such Member’s
Membership in the Association in accordance with and subject to
Article 5, termination of such Member’s Membership in the
Association, or a determination by a majority of the Board of
