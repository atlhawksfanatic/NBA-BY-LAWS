             (g) If, by a three-fourths (3/4) vote, the Board of
Governors votes to sustain the charges, the Membership of the guilty
Member or the Member in which the guilty Owner has an interest shall
automatically be terminated, unless, following a motion duly made and

provisions of Article 15.

with the foregoing procedure shall be final, binding, and conclusive,
and each Member and Owner waives any and all recourse to any court
of law to review any such decision.
