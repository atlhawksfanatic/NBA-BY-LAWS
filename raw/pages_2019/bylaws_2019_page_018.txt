             (a) An application requesting approval of a transfer must
be made in writing to the Commissioner by the applicable Member (on
behalf of the transferring Owner) promptly after an agreement with
respect to such transfer has been reached. The Commissioner may
waive this requirement and accept an application directly from a
Prospective Owner that has a security interest previously approved by
the Association in the interest proposed to be transferred or when, in
the Commissionerâ€™s sole judgment, the best interests of the Association
would be served.
             (b) Upon receipt of such application, the Commissioner
shall have the right to require from the transferring Owner, and the
transferring Owner shall furnish or cause the proposed transferee to
furnish to the Commissioner, such information as the Commissioner
shall request about the transfer, the proposed transferee and each
Prospective Owner, any persons or Entities with which the transferee or
any Prospective Owner is associated or affiliated, and such other
matters, whether or not confidential, as the Commissioner shall deem
relevant in his sole discretion. The transferring Owner and its proposed
transferee and each of its Prospective Owners shall also execute,
deliver, and perform, and shall cause such other parties (including their
respective controlled subsidiaries and affiliates) as the Commissioner
shall direct to execute, deliver, and perform, such documents in such
forms as the Commissioner shall prescribe. It shall be the obligation of
the transferring Owner to ensure that the Commissioner timely receives
all information that the Commissioner may request under this Article 5.
             (c) Any agreement to transfer an interest in a Member or
Membership, and any application requesting approval of such transfer,
shall include a binding agreement of the proposed transferee and each
of its Prospective Owners stating that if the transfer is approved by the
Association, the proposed transferee and each of its Prospective
Owners (and each of their respective controlled subsidiaries and
affiliates) shall be bound by the Constitution and By-Laws, rules,
regulations, resolutions, and agreements of the Association, and any
modifications or amendments thereof.
