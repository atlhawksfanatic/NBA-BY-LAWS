                               ARTICLE 38
                                PROTEST
             (a) In order for a Member to protest against or appeal
from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the
Commissioner within forty-eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said
game, by a Writing, stating therein the grounds for such protest. No
protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the
Regular Season after midnight of the day of the last game of the
Regular Season. A protest in connection with a Playoff Game must be
filed not later than midnight of the day of the game protested. A game
may be protested only by a Governor, Alternate Governor, General
Manager, or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to
the allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other Member who can
show an interest in the grounds of protest and the results that might be
attained if the protest were allowed. No protest shall be valid unless
the Written Notice to the Commissioner thereof is accompanied by a
check in the sum of $10,000 (the “Protest Fee”) payable to the order of
the Association. If the Member filing the protest prevails, the Protest
Fee is to be refunded. If the Member does not prevail, the Protest Fee
is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury.
             (b) Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at
once notify the Member operating the opposing Team in the game
protested and require both of said Members within five (5) days to file
with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The
Commissioner shall decide the question raised within five (5) days after
receipt of such evidence.
