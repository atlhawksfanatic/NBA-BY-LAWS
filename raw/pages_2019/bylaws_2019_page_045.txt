however, that any action to approve an application for Membership in
the Association pursuant to Article 4, or requiring termination of a
Membership pursuant to Article 13, or to dissolve the Association
pursuant to Article 16, may not be taken or adopted except at a meeting
of the Board of Governors or by a Writing consented to by all the

             (b) In lieu of calling a special meeting of the Board of
Governors under Article 19(b), the Commissioner may call a meeting
in which members of the Board of Governors participate by
teleconferencing or any other means of communication that enables all
persons participating in the meeting to hear each other. All provisions
of this Constitution and By-Laws applicable to special meetings
(including, but not limited to, provisions relating to quorums and
voting) shall apply to such meetings, except that the Written Notice of
such meetings shall be given to the Governors so that in the normal
course it will be received no later than 48 hours prior to the meeting.
Notice of meeting may be waived by any Member and shall be deemed
waived by a Member’s participation in the meeting unless the Member
shall object to the absence of timely notice at the outset of the meeting.
Members of the Board of Governors shall not be permitted to
participate by such alternative means of communication in meetings
called under Article 19.
