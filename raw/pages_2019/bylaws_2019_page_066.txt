                          LITIGATION COSTS
             (a) In any action in which a claim or counterclaim is
brought by one or more Members or their Owners (each a “Claiming
Party”) against any of (i) the Association, (ii) a majority of the
Members (or the Owners of a majority of the Members), (iii) any Entity
directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a majority of the Members
(or a majority of the direct or indirect owners of such Entity), or (iv) the
Commissioner or any other executive or employee of the Association
(clauses (i) – (iv) collectively, the “Association Parties”), the following
shall apply:
                    (i) unless the Claiming Parties shall fully prevail
             on the merits of each and every claim or counterclaim
             brought against the Association Parties, the Claiming
             Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold
             harmless the Association Parties against all costs, fees and
             expenses of every kind and description that the Association
             Parties may incur in connection with the action (including,
             but not limited to, all reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in
             such action between the Claiming Party and the
             Association Parties) (collectively, “Litigation Costs”);
                    (ii) even if a Claiming Party prevails on the merits
             of each and every claim or counterclaim brought against
             the Association Parties, it shall remain liable for its share of
             all Litigation Costs incurred by the Association Parties in
             connection with the action (the Claiming Party’s share to
             be determined by dividing the Litigation Costs by the
             number of members of the Association); and
                    (iii) each Member and Owner hereby waives any
             right it may have to recover its Litigation Costs from the
             Association Parties, and agrees not to seek or accept
             reimbursement of such Litigation Costs, in connection with
