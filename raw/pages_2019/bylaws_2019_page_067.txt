                                                                   59
           any action in which such Member or Owner is a Claiming
           Party.
           (b) In any action in which a claim is brought by the
Association Parties against one or more Members or their Owners
(each a “Defending Party”), the following shall apply:
                  (i) if the Association Parties shall prevail on the
           merits of any claim brought against the Defending Parties,
           the Defending Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify
           and hold harmless the Association Parties against all
           Litigation Costs that the Association Parties may incur in
           connection with such claim; and
                  (ii) even if the Association Parties do not prevail
           on each and every claim brought against the Defending
           Parties, each Defending Party shall remain liable for its
           share of all Litigation Costs incurred by the Association
           Parties in connection with the action (the Defending Party’s
           share to be determined by dividing the Litigation Costs by
           the number of Members of the Association).
