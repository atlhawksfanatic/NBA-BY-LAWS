             (a) An annual meeting of the Board of Governors shall
be held, at about the same time each year, on a date and at a place to be
fixed by the Commissioner.
             (b) Special meetings may be called by the Commissioner
at any time and shall be called by the Commissioner whenever a

                        NOTICE OF MEETINGS
             Prior Written Notice of all meetings of the Board of
Governors shall be given to each Governor. Each such notice shall set
forth so far as is reasonably possible the purpose for which the meeting
is called and shall be given sufficiently in advance of the meeting so
that in the normal course the Writing will be received no later than
ninety-six (96) hours prior to the meeting. Notice of the meeting may
be waived by any Member and shall be deemed waived by a Memberâ€™s
attendance at a meeting unless the Member shall object to the absence
of timely notice at the outset of the meeting.

                                QUORUM
             Governors representing a majority of the Members shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business unless otherwise
provided herein. No quorum, once present, shall be broken by the
departure of any Governors.
