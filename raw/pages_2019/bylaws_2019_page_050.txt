assessments and make such payments as shall be ordered by the
Commissioner or the Board of Governors, and shall be bonded by
companies, and in an amount, satisfactory to the Board of Governors.
The Treasurer shall annually render a report of all his receipts and
disbursements to the Board of Governors. At the expiration of the
Treasurer’s term of office, the Treasurer shall account for the delivery
to the Board of Governors of all monies, books, papers, and property
received by the Treasurer by virtue of that office. In default of election
of a Treasurer, or while the Treasurer’s office is vacant, the

for the faithful performance of their duties as the Board of Governors
may deem proper.
