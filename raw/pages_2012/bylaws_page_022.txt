      (i) If a proposed transfer involves (x) a larger than
five percent (5%) but smaller than ten percent (10%)
interest in a Member or Membership (including an interest
subject to Article 5(h)(iii)), or (y) the transfer of a
Membership or an interest in a Member or Membership to a
different Entity owned by substantially the same Owners in
substantially the same proportions (provided that the
aggregate direct and indirect changes in ownership, if any,
do not equal or exceed ten percent (10%)), the Committee
shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to approve such
proposed transfer without submitting it to the Members for
approval under Article 5(f) above, unless (A) the transfer
would result in any person or Entity (or group of persons or
Entities acting in concert) that has not been approved by the
Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of ten
percent (10%) or larger in a Member or Membership, or
(B) the effect of such proposed transfer is or may be to
change the ownership of effective control of such Member
or Membership.

percent (5%) or smaller interest in a Member or
Membership, or (y) the transfer of a Membership or an
interest in a Member or Membership to a different Entity
owned by substantially the same Owners in substantially

and indirect changes in ownership, if any, do not exceed
five percent (5%)), the Commissioner shall have the power,
in his sole discretion, to approve such proposed transfer
without submitting it to the Members for approval under
Article 5(f) above, unless (A) the transfer would result in
any person or Entity (or group of persons or Entities acting
in concert) that has not been approved by the Committee or
the Members directly or indirectly owning an interest of
larger than five percent (5%) but smaller than ten percent
