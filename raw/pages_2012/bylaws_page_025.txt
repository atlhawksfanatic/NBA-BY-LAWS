within or outside its existing Territory, as defined in Article 10, only in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Article 7 and,
where applicable, the provisions of Articles 8 and/or 9.
             (a) Application to relocate must be made in writing by
the Member to the Commissioner. The application shall identify the

sum of $50,000, if the proposed new location is within the Member’s
Territory, or $250,000, if the proposed new location is outside of the
