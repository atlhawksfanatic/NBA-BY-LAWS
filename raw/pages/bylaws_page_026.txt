            existing and projected business environment; the size,
            quality, and location of the Member’s existing arena and
            any other arena in the existing location, and the terms, if
            any, on which that other arena would be available to the
            Member; and the presence, history, and popularity in the
            existing location of other professional sports teams and
            other forms of entertainment.
                   (iii) The ability of the proposed new location to

            location is within the existing Territory of a Member, the
            ability of the proposed new location to support another
            Team. In evaluating this factor, the Relocation Committee
            shall consider the following criteria with respect to the

            projected population, income levels and age distribution;
