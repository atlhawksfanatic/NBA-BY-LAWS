                                                                       57
           harmless the Association Parties against all costs, fees and
           expenses of every kind and description that the Association
           Parties may incur in connection with the action (including,
           but not limited to, all reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in
           such action between the Claiming Party and the
           Association Parties) (collectively, “Litigation Costs”);
                  (ii) even if a Claiming Party prevails on the merits
           of each and every claim or counterclaim brought against
           the Association Parties, it shall remain liable for its share of
           all Litigation Costs incurred by the Association Parties in
           connection with the action (the Claiming Party’s share to
           be determined by dividing the Litigation Costs by the
           number of members of the Association); and
                  (iii) each Member and Owner hereby waives any
           right it may have to recover its Litigation Costs from the
           Association Parties, and agrees not to seek or accept
           reimbursement of such Litigation Costs, in connection with
           any action in which such Member or Owner is a Claiming
           Party.
           (b) In any action in which a claim is brought by the
Association Parties against one or more Members or their Owners
(each a “Defending Party”), the following shall apply:
                  (i) if the Association Parties shall prevail on the
           merits of any claim brought against the Defending Parties,
           the Defending Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify
           and hold harmless the Association Parties against all
           Litigation Costs that the Association Parties may incur in
           connection with such claim; and
                  (ii) even if the Association Parties do not prevail
           on each and every claim brought against the Defending
           Parties, each Defending Party shall remain liable for its
           share of all Litigation Costs incurred by the Association
