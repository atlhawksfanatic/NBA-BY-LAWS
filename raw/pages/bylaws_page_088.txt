                                                                        75
                     (ii) The remaining Teams that did not qualify to
              participate in the Playoffs in the preceding Season shall
              then select, in inverse order of their consolidated standings
              at the end of the preceding Season; and
                     (iii) The Teams that participate in the Playoffs shall
              then select, in inverse order of their consolidated standings
              at the end of the preceding Season. The foregoing shall
              afford each Team one selection.
              (b) In the second round of the NBA Draft, draft choices
shall be made in inverse order of the consolidated standings of all
Teams at the close of the preceding Season, one selection at a time.
              (c) In the first round of the NBA Draft, if any Teams are
tied on a percentage basis, then priority in selection as between such
Teams is to be established on the basis of a drawing among the Teams
involved, except that if the tied Teams are Lottery Teams, priority in
selection may be determined by the Lottery. As between the Teams
participating in any such drawing, the winner shall have the right to the
earliest selection in the first round of the Draft, followed by the other
tied Teams participating in the drawing, in accordance with the results
of the drawing. In the second round of the Draft, if only two Teams are
tied, the tied Teams shall reverse the order in which they selected in the
first round; if more than two Teams are tied, then, as among the tied
teams, each tied Team shall select one position earlier than it selected
in the first round, except that the tied Team that selected earliest in the
first round shall, among the tied Teams, select latest in the second
round.
              (d) A Member that has drafted a Player in the NBA Draft
shall have such rights to negotiate with and sign such Player consistent
with the rules and regulations that may be adopted from time to time by
the Board of Governors and/or with provisions of any collective
bargaining agreement(s) entered into by the Association.
