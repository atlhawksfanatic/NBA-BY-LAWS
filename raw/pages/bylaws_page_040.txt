                                                                      29
             (h) Notwithstanding Article 14(g) above, in the case of a
violation of Article 13 by an Owner who has an interest of ten percent
(10%) or less in, and does not have effective control over, a Member,
the Membership of such Member may not be terminated solely because
of such Owner’s violation. In such case, if the charges are sustained
against such Owner by a three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Board of
Governors, the ownership interest of that Owner shall be automatically
terminated unless, following a motion duly made and seconded, two-

15.
             (i) If any Membership or interest of an Owner shall be
terminated pursuant to this Article 14, the provisions of Article 14A
shall apply.
             (j) The decisions of the Association made in accordance
with the foregoing procedure shall be final, binding, and conclusive,
and each Member and Owner waives any and all recourse to any court
of law to review any such decision.
